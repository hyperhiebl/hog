beschreibung: "Here’s the last page of Ionel’s side story “Encore”, which marks the
  end of that little glimpse we caught into Ionel’s past.\n\nCreating this comic was
  a wild ride for me, since it’s the first “real” comic I ever drew. Naturally, Eli
  helped me a lot during the whole process. Still, many parts were a first for me
  and it wasn’t easy but I loved going through the whole process and ending up with
  11 rendered pages that I can be proud of.  \nThis side story is very important to
  me and I’m excited to have shared it with you all, since I wanted to show more facets
  of Ionel. I hope you enjoyed it!  \n– Viv"
