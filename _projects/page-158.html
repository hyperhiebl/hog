beschreibung: "Here’s the tenth and last page of Ionel’s side story “Encore”.  \nThus,
  this page marks the end of that little glimpse we caught into Ionel’s past.\n\nCreating
  this comic honestly was a wild ride for me, since it’s the first “real” comic I
  ever drew. Naturally, Eli helped me a lot during the whole process, like writing
  the story together, them doing all the thumbnails, redlining my sketches etc. Still,
  many parts were a first for me and it wasn’t easy but I loved going through the
  whole process and ending up with 10 rendered pages that I can be proud of.  \nThis
  side story is very important to me and I’m excited to have shared it with you all,
  since I wanted to show more facets of Ionel. I hope you enjoyed it! Thank you so
  much for sticking with me for these 10 weeks ![❤](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/svg/2764.svg)![\U0001F3B6](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/svg/1f3b6.svg)❤
